I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Junzhou Huang](https://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/). Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Applied Bioscience from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie broadly in Multi-modal Learning, e.g., Multi-modal LLM, Multi-modal Representation Learning, Multi-modal Fusion, Multi-instance Learning, and their application on computational pathology.

I am actively looking for 25 Summar intern and academic collaboration, feel free to email me.
